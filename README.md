# VRChat Avatar Uploader
A simple program to upload avatars to VRChat.  Built for Avatar creators to distribute avatars to their clients without the need to request login details.

## ðŸš¨ Currently nonfunctional!
Still working out some bugs.  If anyone has any advice Id be very happy to accept!

VRChat flags any uploaded avatars with "Security checks failed".  Maybe the package building from unity is missing something?  Possible that building the testing file misses some critical information inside the bundle that the typical build does?

## BUILDING VRCA FILES FROM UNITY

Download and add the file [`./BundleExporter.cs`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArcaneBlackwood/VRChat-Avatar-Uploader/main/BundleExporter.cs) to your Unity project, you can put it anywhere inside your Assets.

In Unity, Ensure you are logged into the VRChat SDK. Goto the menu at the top and click `VRChat SDK` -> `Utilities` -> `Bundle Exporter`.  You can then select the avatar you want to export, click `Export Bundle`, and choose a location to save the exported bundle.  This exported file can then be imported into the avatar uploader.
